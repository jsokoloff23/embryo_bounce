## About
Hello! 

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This program has only been tested on Python 3.10.1 and 3.10.11. Other Python versions
in this range or later versions may work but use at your own risk.

For macOS users, MediaPipe version 0.10.10 does NOT work correctly on macOS. Version 0.10.9 is 
completely fine. As long as modules from requirements.txt are installed, this shouldn't be an issue.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jsokoloff23/embryo_bounce
   ```
2. Install dependencies from requirements.txt file
   ```sh
   pip install -r <cloned_repo_directory>/requirements.txt
   ```

### Starting

1. Run the `main.py` file located in the embryo_bounce folder and enjoy!
 ```sh
 python <cloned_repo_directory>/embry_bounce/main.py
 ```
